WebGL HousePlanner - 3D Home Staging
====================================

WebGL experiment based on Three.js for generating floorplans and decorative 3D home staging.

Originally the project was created for real-estate agents to showcase WebGL abilities but dismissed due to lack of funding.
It is currently unfinished (~10%) but has great concept ideas: exterior view, multi-floor 3D furnishings and 2D floor plans.

Now available as open-source.
